# Calm Cactus

Calm Cactus is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The production site will be hosted at [calmcact.us](https://calmcact.us)

## Getting Started


First install the project's dependencies with `npm i`, then disable telemetry with `npx next telemetry disable`.

Then run the development server with `npm run start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy

Build the static site assets:

```
npm run export
```

Upload the resulting `out` directory to your hosting provider.
