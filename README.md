# Calm Cactus

Calm Cactus is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The production site is hosted for free by GitHub Pages at [calmcact.us](https://calmcact.us).

## Getting Started


First install the project's dependencies with `npm i`, then disable telemetry with `npx next telemetry disable`.

Run the development server with `npm run start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy

This site is statically exported and is hosted on GitHub Pages. To update the production site, run the export command and commit the results. The site will be automatically updated momentarily after pushing. The web root is `docs/` in order to be compatible with GitHub Pages.

```
npm run export
git add docs
git commit -m "Briefly describe changes being released in this deployment"
git push
```
